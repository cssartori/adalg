# Implementation of Advanced Algorithms  #

This repository contains the implementation of some well-known Advanced Algorithms from Computer Science. It includes specific Data Structures as well. The list below shows each one:

* Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Paths using k-heap;
* Heap implementations: k-heap and Hollow Heaps;
* Bipartide Matching;
* Maximum Flow Algorithms;
* 3/2-Approximation Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (Christofide's Algorithm);
* Union-find Data Structure;

## Development ##

The language of choice is C++(11) for performance.

## About ##
Done by Carlo S. Sartori

Mostly for "CMP 588 - Advanced Algorithms" course, at UFRGS - 2017/1.
