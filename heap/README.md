# Heap Data Structure #

Implementation of heap data structures. Two heaps are available so far:

* k-heaps: heaps where nodes have up to k children;
* hollow heaps: heaps where some nodes may be "hollow", allowing a better amortized complexity than conventional heaps;

They all respect the same interface, defined by an abstract class Heap.
